# credit-risk-classification

The purpose of this is to practice, develop and evaluate a machine learning model to predict the credit risk of loans by classifying them into "healthy" or "high-risk" categories.

Key Points:

Purpose: Predict credit risk using a logistic regression model.

Data source: Included loan and financial information (e.g., income, debt).

Target Variable: loan_status with two classes:
0 (Healthy Loan): Low risk of default.
1 (High-Risk Loan): High risk of default.

Methodology/Process:
Data Preparation: Split dataset into training and testing subsets.
Model Training: Trained a logistic regression model.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated using a confusion matrix and classification report.

Results:
Class 0 (Healthy Loan):
Precision: 1.00
Recall: 1.00
F1-Score: 1.00
Class 1 (High-Risk Loan):
Precision: 0.87
Recall: 0.95
F1-Score: 0.91
Overall Accuracy: 0.99

As an results:
Best Performing Model: Logistic regression with high accuracy and balanced performance.
Purpose: Suitable for applications needing high recall for high-risk loans and overall reliable predictions.
